        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for crafting clean code and creating smooth, intuitive user experiences. My journey into web development began out of curiosity—I was fascinated by how websites worked and wanted to build my own. What started as simple experiments with HTML and CSS quickly grew into a deep interest in JavaScript, responsive design, and the art of making the web both beautiful and functional.</p>
        <p>Learning on my own wasn't always easy. I faced plenty of challenges, from debugging stubborn code to keeping up with the ever-evolving world of web technologies. But each obstacle taught me something valuable: perseverance, resourcefulness, and the importance of a learning mindset. I thrive on solving problems and enjoy the creative process of turning ideas into interactive digital experiences.</p>
        <p>Beyond coding, I value creativity, consistency, and continuous growth. When I'm not working on web projects, you'll find me exploring new tech, sketching ideas, or enjoying a good book. I believe that great work comes from a blend of curiosity, dedication, and a willingness to learn from every experience.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm always looking to grow and collaborate on exciting projects—let's build something amazing together!</strong></p><br><br>
        <p>Check out some of my recent projects showcasing different technologies and skills.</p>
